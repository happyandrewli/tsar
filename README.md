<h1 align="center">Time Series Analytic Repository (TSAR)</h1>

<div align="center">
  The Time Series Analytic Repository (TSAR) is an integrated system of software and data for the storage and manipulation of economic time series. Economic time series are vectors of data values where each data value represents the level of some economic activity for a specified time period. This system is designed to create, save, access, manipulate, and display economic time series. The systems integrated tools are available in an interactive graphical user interface computing environment.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

## Quickstart

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run mock:server` to launch a fake REST API locally. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/series` to see the data. Here are some examples of the different ways to query the data `https://github.com/typicode/json-server`.

The API is also exposed on the public internet from my GitHub repository: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/happyandrewli/tsar-poc/series.
